# WARNING: draft-03 is DEPRECATED
JSON meta schema `draft-03` has been deprecated by json-schema.org please migrate to a newer draft version as soon as 
possible.

# Update your implementation
As `draft-03` is deprecated you should no longer use it. Update your implementation to use e.g. `draft-07`. 
You may update to a newer library version or to other lib, validator, form UI vendors that support `draft-07` schema 
files. 

# More details on draft-03
See [old Freifunk API Schema (draft-03) with wrapper](../README.md) for explanation why `<repo>/specs/draft-03/*.json` is better then `<repo>/specs/*.json` 
(if you want to stay at draft-03).
